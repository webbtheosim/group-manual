    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific manuscripts are often the most tangible and externally visible manifestation of your research. Writing a good manuscript is hard work, but it is a very useful skill to have. Believe me: delivering clear and concise statements that accurately convey information is broadly useful and widely appreciated in both academic and industrial settings. In addition, Prof. Webb (and by extension, the group) takes pride in producing high-quality, well-written, and attractive manuscripts. At times, it may seem the extra effort is not worth it. Do people notice? If something is great, maybe. If something is bad, definitely. The goal is to effectively communicate the science. This necessitates clear writing. This requires sensible figure composition. Anything less is a distraction. This is important. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the following sections is to provide guidance and promote consistency for manuscript preparation and publication. Following the recommendations set forthshould not only reduce the editorial burden on Prof. Webb but also simplify the writing process and result in an overall better product in less time. I recommend all students read this multiple times and revisit as necessary. Over time, you will and should develop your own sense of style and approach to writing, but you should also appreciate that what follows is a distillation of many years of experience of writing and observation. Therefore, this should establish a common baseline for navigationg \"the process\" with useful and actionable approaches to requisite steps therein."

    "## The Process: a 1000 ft view\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the process of developing, submitting, and publishing a manuscript in our group involves roughly 10 steps. There are some deviations from this (e.g., to meet a pressing a deadline), but I would consider this most ideal for development. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. **Conceptualization** - Folks often wonder when they should begin writing a paper. We can debate when the actually writing should begin, but the process begins at the outset. Research should be generally undertaken with a given hypothesis, question, demonstration, or application at the forefront of our minds. For me, it is helpful to consider *\"what would be the title for a paper featuring this research?\"* Additionally, I consider possible analyses and calculations based on how they might manifest as figures. What would the order of the figures be? This conceptual sketch of the paper gets us off the ground and into something tangible. \n",
    "   2. **Execution** - During this stage, the focus is on progressing research based on the concept and not on the actual writing or figure composition. As research progresses, we should continually revisit and evolve our conceptual narrative based on the data and what we learn. Therefore, we should always reflect on the research goals and questions to guide the next steps in the research. Often group meetings and small presentations are opportunities to evaluate a working narrative and get feedback. Of course, the final product may substantially differ from that initially envisioned in Step 1. Note that there is a difference between \"losing sight\" of the narrative and \"evolving\" the narrative. The former means we have been perhaps too careless and taken by whimsy; the latter typically means we have encountered something unexpected that necessarily requires us to revisit our initial questions. \n",
    "   3. **Storyboarding** - During this phase, you will distill your results into a set of digestible figures coupled with text that delivers clear points. Commonly, we return to *Step 2* for additional work that seems necessary to strengthen the narrative and future manuscript. By the end of this part, this altogether yields a cohesive scientific narrative with which all coauthors agree.\n",
    "   4. **Drafting** - At this stage, the storyboard is converted to actual manuscript form. This is a major undertaking, but with the hard work that comes prior, it should not be as laborious as expected. The result should resemble a paper in form and function, with no major elements missing, although significant revision will follow.\n",
    "   5. **Internal revision** (self $\\times M$) - After producing a complete document, it is probably tempting to inform me that \"the manuscript is ready for review!\" You are right, but the first reviewer should be you and not me. The *Drafting* phase already substantially depends on self-revision but usually in a micro sense. Here, you should take time to assess the manuscript both wholistically in its presentation as well as details. Soliciting the opinion of a labmate would also be a good idea. If the manuscript is too rough to show them, then it needs more work from your side first. Ideally, with the recommendations from this guide, subsequent steps should go over easier.\n",
    "   6. **Internal revision (me $\\times N$)** - Once you have a completed and (what you believe to be) cohesive draft, ping me for comments. At first, I will look for major structural/logical/organizational elements that require attention. I will pay more attention to the progression of ideas and presentation of the figures. I will read the introductory paragraphs to ensure that we are providing necessary information in proper context of the literature; I will look at the reference list. The text associated with methods/results will be visited briefly--usually at a subsection/topic sentence/conclusion level. The rationale is that structural changes will impact the writing, such that it is premature to focus too heavily on it. I expect that comments will be specifically and transferibly addressed. By transferibly, I mean that the essence of the comment should be taken to heart and applied throughout the manuscript, even if not specifically noted elsewhere; this especially applies to figures. At early stages and iterations, I will likely make it partway through the manuscript, while you improve the latter parts based on earlier suggestions. We will do this as many times as necessary to obtain a high-quality draft.\n",
    "   7. **Fine-tuning and proofing** - With a high-quality draft, we will turn to fine-tuning and word-smithing. Edits primarily emphasize clarity and concision. Recently, we have found it useful to also solicit the group to catch obvious typos and grammatical errors prior to a submission. This exercise is also beneficial for the group, as they can also experience writing in the group before they might have done it themselves. \n",
    "   8. **Submission and peer-review** - Before submitting, we need to put something together, which I call a ``submission package.`` The submission packages consists of: \n",
    "        * Main text manuscript files\n",
    "        * Cover letter (I typically write)\n",
    "        * Supporting information text\n",
    "        * Supporting information files/data (sometimes submitted to data repository if warranted)\n",
    "        * List of ~5 possible referees\n",
    "        * TOC figure (if required)\n",
    "\n",
    "    While it is not so many things, generally putting all this together does take more time than it seems like it should. After submitting at the journal (and a preprint server), we then wait to see if the paper is sent out for review and wait to receive comments. This is usually a 1-2 month process for most journals. We then receive around 2-4 referee reports that determine the next steps.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   9. **Revision and Response to Reviewers** - After receipt of the referee reports, I will forward to all coauthors and set up a time to discuss. Because we have put in a lot of effort into preparing the manuscript, the most common outcome is that referees will indicate either \"minor revisions\" or \"major revisions,\" and the moniker of \"major revisions\" may practically reduce to fairly minor changes but those that the referee feels more strongly about. It is more rare than not that addressing referee critiques requires additional calculations or new simulations -- again, we will have thought very hard about the scientific narrative and the analyses to make its case. There are also often some small requests from the editorial office that need to be addressed. It is my preference to keep the revision period as short as reasonable to be wholly responsive. Unless there are other urgent things going on, addressing the critiques is a top priority. Ideally, we need only do one round of revisions, but sometimes two are needed. There will be an additional section on crafting compelling response documents.\n",
    "   10. **Acceptance and proofing** - After receiving our response documents and reviewing changes, the editorial staff will make a decision on the manuscript, which we aim to be \"accept\" right out of the gate. The process from here is easy, and you can rejoice and breathe a sigh of relief. There are usually some small administrative things that need to happen (signing author agreements, etc.), but closely examining the proofs is by far the most important activity that requires your participation and attention. Here, the journal staff will typeset a version of the manuscript in their template and distribute this along with some questions. We want to principally identify typographical, grammatical, or equation-based errors. Very small tweaks to language can be recommended if our prior text was ambiguous or inaccurate in some way, but generally, this is not the time for any substantive changes. This is our last chance to make edits, so we need to catch everything!"

    "## Software and Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manuscript preparation\n",
    "Most of the manuscripts in the group are prepared using LaTex and collaboratively shared via Overleaf. When we make a decision to start drafting, one of us will create and share an overleaf document using an appropriate journal template. We will choose the appropriate template based on our intended journal target, but it is relatively easy to swap templates in LaTex. On rarer occasions, Word may be used, but this is predominantly if we are participating on a collaborative work with experimental groups that insist on its use. \n",
    "\n",
    "### DropBox Folder\n",
    "When we start to write a manuscript, a folder will be created to manage all final files. This will be in ``Webb_group-->Manuscripts--><folder>``. Predominantly, this folder is used to organize everything for submission and coordinate preparation of figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference manager\n",
    "In an effort to make managing references easier, we have set up a workflow through GitHub to update and share a common, growing bibliography file. I highly suggest using a program like ``JabRef`` (tutorial by Carlos on the DropBox) to keep track of papers and references. I have managed my references manually and also previously used ``BibDesk``, ``Zotero``, and ``Mendeley``. Don't make my mistakes--start using a reference manager now. For me, ``JabRef`` takes it. One nice thing about JabRef, other than the organization, is that it can be configured to automatically provided citation keys in a desired format; my preference is that we use citation keys of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "``R:YearPublished_LastNameOfFirstAuthor_ShortTitle``\n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest starting your reference set from my working version, which is located in the group DropBox folder: \n",
    "\n",
    "``Webb_group --> References --> group_references.bib``. \n",
    "\n",
    "The GitHub is at https://github.com/webbtheosim/group_references\n",
    "\n",
    "Honestly, we don't push/pull from this as often as we should; it tends to happen just around manuscript-writing time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Journal Templates and Formats\n",
    "As mentioned before, it is desirable to use a journal template where possible. Also, when we have selected a target journal, you should review their style guide and examine recent articles from that journal to get a sense of format/presentation. What sections/subsections are present? Where are the methods located? Are there restrictions on content length or number of figures? Are captions formatted in any particular way? It's better to take stock in these things earlier than later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Figure Software\n",
    "Most of the plots that we create are generated using ``Python``. In terms of compositing plots into figures with multiple panels, I recommend either using ``PowerPoint``, ``InkScape``, or ``Illustrator``. I actually prefer ``PowerPoint`` because it is simple, although there is a trick that needs to be employed to ensure that the figures are generated at high resolution. It is useful for me to have access to the source figures so I can make edits as needed during crunch time. Also, it is useful to have these things for presentations and the like. Your source files should be deposited in the appropriate DropBox folder. There will be more about figures later."

    "## Storyboarding\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it's time to write a paper, huh? I have experienced doing this several different ways. In my opinion, *storyboarding* is the most efficient approach and makes actually writing the easiest. Here, the objective is to solidify in your mind and mine what it is that we are actually trying to convey. To do so, you are encouraged to create a ``PowerPoint`` presentation with the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Draft of all figures and corresponding *full* figure captions\n",
    "    2. For each figure, a couple of *complete* sentences that summarize the key takeaways and major findings that derive from the figure.\n",
    "    3. A draft of the abstract.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The discussion in a manuscript is centered around the figures, so it makes sense to start by nailing these down. The figures themselves we can consider as our evidence for specific conclusions. We will quickly ascertain whether the evidence, as presented, is sufficient to justify the conclusions, which you will also be summarizing. Notice that I request a reporting of key takeaways and major findings as *complete* sentences. The rationale for this is two-fold. First, I find that presentation of ideas in the forms of bullets and sentence fragments allows one to get away with corresponding fragmented thoughts. By writing a complete sentence, one has to mentally work through the idea and ensure that it is coherent enough to warrant punctuation. Second, these sentences may comprise the first versions of ``topic`` or ``concluding`` sentences in manuscript drafts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of writing an abstract (without yet any manuscript text!), the logic is similar to forcing one to write a complete sentence. To write the abstract, the scientic narrative must be clear enough to you that it can be expressed in a succinct and well-organized paragraph. Often people leave the abstract till the end, but I view this as a mistake/missed opportunity. Writing the abstract early gives the manuscript direction from the get-go, and this should resonate with the the present set of figures. If the content and meaning of each figure is clear and if the progression of figures is cohesive, then this should not be a tall task. If it is unclear, then it means we probably still have work to do. This abstract is, of course, just a first pass and will be revisited later during the manuscript preparation stage."

    "## Guidelines for Figure Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "### The objective...\n",
    "\n",
    "Figures are the foci of most manuscripts. It is important that these are clean, cohesive, illustrative, and polished. \n",
    "You might have been asked or asked yourself \"Wait, what are you showing here? What does this mean?\" Those are not questions we want asked. It should be evident/discernible from the plots themselves. \n",
    "Furthermore, note that some kinds of plots are more effective than others at making specific points. \n",
    "I have heard comments in the past about how certain styles of plots are \"bad.\" That wholly depends on what the purpose of the plot is. Are you trying to compare how something changes as a function of a dependent variable, or are you aiming to make comparisons between functional behaviors? The same style plot may be bad or good but not in isolation; it depends on the purpose/interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also often a tendency to describe the components of the figure (e.g., this line goes up and then goes down, this line is above that line, etc.). This also relates to recommendations on writing, but in my view, those kind of statements are pedantic and unnecessary. There can be exceptions for some subtle features here and there, but major points ought to be predicated on features that should be *obvious* to a discerning person based on the figure and choices made during its composition.     \n",
    "\n",
    "I consider scientific writing to be similar to (but less boring than) prosecution in a court of law. The concept is that we are building a case for an idea to be accepted into the corpus of scientific understanding. The figures (and their composite panels) are our evidence that the idea *should* be accepted, that it is true beyond a reasonable doubt. In fact, the analyses and their portrayal should be convincing enough that a reasonable jury of our peers (scientific colleagues), upon examination of the figures presented, would be inclined to agree that it is correct and reasonable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not only should the figures be clear enough that readers have such an inclination, but \n",
    "actually, I would prefer that readers formulate *the same conclusions* from the figures, even in the absence of our exposition. Note that this preference is also a practical matter, as many process papers by just flipping through the figures. If the figures are engaging and compelling, then perhaps it will get a closer read. \n",
    "\n",
    "### General requests/advice\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Prepare figures at the size intended for printed display.* This presents the highest chance that the appearance of the figure will be as intended with features and text both predictable and evident at a high-resolution. Single-column figures are usually alloted a width of 3.3in; double-column, spanning figures have a width of 7.0in. It is good to check journal guidelines. \n",
    "* *Utilize consistent, human-readable text size.* From an accessibility nad aesthetics perspective, all text should essentially be in the range of font size 8-12. I don't like having anything smaller than 8. Text size typically diminishes as we move inwards towards the data, such that panel labels are at 12 $\\geq$ axes labels $\\geq$ tick labels $\\sim$ legend text $\\geq$ annotation text. Panel labels should be consistent size across all figures. \n",
    "* *Utilize consistent font schemes throughout.* Employ the same kind of font style across your figures. I have some preference for the simple *sans serif* fonts (e.g., Arial), although I admit that symbols in equations sometimes become hard to discern. If you are using a *serif*\n",
    "* *Pay attention to the style of good figures.* Closely examine figures created in papers previously published by Webb and the group. It is also good to note nice figures in articles that you have read, particularly from journals similar to that targeted for submission.\n",
    "* *Use stylistic \"choices\" to your advantage.* More broadly, the statement might be \"have a reason for things.\" We should use things like color schemes and other visual elements with intent. These choices should help the reader understand and appreciate salient aspects of the data. We can also connect with and exploit intuition. Are we showing data across a range of temperatures? Maybe data at high temperatures should be associated with warm colors and data at low temperatures should be associated with cool ones. You should also \"put yourself in the reader's shoes.\" Is it possible that a reader may form uninented mental associations based on your choices? If so, we may reconsider how the data is presented. I will help you through this. Be thoughtful, and we will go from there.\n",
    "* *Be considerate to those with color blindness.* We will talk more about colors elsewhere. To be brief here, if possible, we should try to use aesthetic color palletes that are also broadly accessible. \n",
    "* *Pay close attention to alignment/placement/arrangement of panels, objects, and text.* This gives an impression of sloppiness for those that notice. I am hyper attentive to these details (seriously), and the issues are easily rectified.   \n",
    "* *Avoid defying convention or inventing new conventions.* This statement applies mostly to trivial things like panel labeling schemes, axes labels, etc. Unconventional but coherent representations of data are certainly fair to consider.\n",
    "* *Deploy useful, existing data visualization/plotting strategies.* Other researchers elsewhere may have come up with really cool ways to show their data. Make use of such good ideas! We shouldn't use objectively worse visualization approaches just because we did not come up with it. Sometimes there is also room to innovate. Attribution will be given where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Figures vs. Panels\n",
    "In most cases, **figures** contain multiple **panels** (a,b,c,d, etc.) that each feature different plots of data. As a guiding principle, the intent of a **figure** is to present thematically related data that convey an overall message/purpose. At early stages of the research process, we may plot things to gain traction, but at the stage of manuscript preparation, you should refine these ideas and make the figures with purpose. It is not the other way around. It is unlikely that the same ole way that you have been conveying the data in weekly meetings is the optimal version for broad dissemination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The panels within the figure should be constructed to make one (or perhaps a few, although this is less desirable) discrete, tangible points. The goal is to have presentations of the data that are meaningful, illusrative, and accurate. Therefore, having a single panel do a lot of heavy lifting is a recipe for reader (and PI) confusion or skepticism. To draw out the courtroom analogy in a macabre way, imagine we are prosecuting someone on a murder charge, and we have the murder weapon (a gun). It would be unconvincing to simply present the murder weapon in its entirety as evidence. No, we separately present a comparison of fingerprints of the defendant compared to those extracted from the weapon, ballistics forensics that show that the bullet recovered from the crime scene is consistent with the ammunition type of the firearm in question, a serial number trace that links the purchase of the firearm to the defendant, etc.   \n",
    "\n",
    "With the framework above, subsection of written discussion are often centered about figures, while paragraphs are centered about related panels. It is OK to have a figure that contains only a single (unlabeled panel). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Captions\n",
    "Captions are important. There are basically two camps. In the first, the captions feature some limited commentary and interpretation of the data. In the second, the caption text is restricted to explaining elements that comprise the figure (i.e., there is no exposition on the meaning of the results). I lean strongly towards the second camp and prefer captions that are largely neutral with respect to any conclusions.\n",
    "In theory, recall that our figures are so well-constructed and explained that the reader has almost no choice but to form the same conclusions as we have. In addition, these points will be delivered in the main text, so it seems redundant to also produce them here. In the same vein, I do not favor explaining stylistic elements of figures in the text; that information should be in the caption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Captions must provide a full description of everything present in the figure/panels to properly understand and interpret the data \n",
    "and sufficiently explain all components such that the reader can understand and appreciate the figure/panels. \n",
    "A common initial error is to under-describe or presume pre-existing knowledge. It is easy to skim or bypass things you know. It is much harder to try to figure out (no pun intended) something that has been ambiguously presented.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In composing the caption, the following are guidelines/recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * ***Begin the caption with a summative fragment or statement.*** Our panels should be thematically related. This summative statement usually indicates what that theme is. Some examples from recent papers include:\n",
    "      * \"Performance of ML model for prediction of mean square radius of gyration, $\\langle R_\\text{g}^2 \\rangle$, for class I and class II polymers.\n",
    "      * \"Overview of systems studied.\"\n",
    "      * \"Relationship between sequence characteristics of precursors and structural features of resulting single-chain nanoparticles.\"\n",
    "      * \"Active-learning approach to heteromeric sequence design.\"\n",
    "      * \"Physicochemical features of sequences at the thermodynamics–dynamics Pareto front.\"\n",
    "      * \"ML guides design of highly stable polymer–protein hybrids.\" -- Notice this last one is a departure from the others in style. It is a collaborative paper and not out-of-place for the venue (*Advanced Materials*). The caption text itself is not very elaborative of the features present.\n",
    "  * ***Avoid combining multiple plots into single panels.*** It's generally preferable to give plots their own label, rather than group them and additionally use \"left, right, center, top, bottom\" etc. There are some exceptions to this. It's definitely a no-go if the plot types/quantities are not the same.\n",
    "  * ***Note all \"non-standard\" or added elements.*** This would include things like insets, guidelines, or marginal axes.\n",
    "  * ***Explain less common data representations.*** Sometimes this changes over time. For example, violin plots were once rare, but now they are all the rage. Neverthless, it is better to be thorough than to risk mis-interpretation. \n",
    "  * ***Explain error bars/regions, ticks, notches, etc.*** Are error bars standard errors, standard deviations, some % confidence intervals? How were they obtained? Are the notches percentiles? Which ones? Etc. This should not devolve into fleshed out methodological descriptions.\n",
    "  * ***Note elements that are shared across panels.*** Many of our studies will feature comparisons of the same kind of data in multiple regimes or systems. Including the same legends and/or axes labels across all figures can make a figure over cluttered. Therefore, it may be appropriate for legends or axes labels to be shared across panels to reduce clutter without losing information. This is indicated by a statement like *\"Note that the axes labels are shared for panels (A)-(C)\"* For legends, they may be placed in the margins or be present in a single panel. If there is an association between parts of a panel and another panel (e.g., via color), then that may be notable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of captions\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some examples that illustrate the expected level of detail and composition. The first bullet provides a base line format.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fig. X. Overall summary of figure theme or point.** (**A**) A plain and simple fragment statement of what is the panel. Subsequent sentences that may follow are full sentences, which will explain panel-specific elements. (**B**) The simple fragment statement of this panel. (**C-E**) A common fragment statement that applies to **(C)** this condition, **(D)** that condition, and **(E)** the other condition. Note that **some subset of panels** may share something in common like axes. In all panels, something may be common such as error bars reflecting standard error of the mean obtained from bootstrap resampling.   \n",
    "* **Fig. 5. Targeted sequence design of size-specific polymers.** (**A**) Statistical comparison of 〈$R_\\text{g}^2$〉 distributions obtained from explicit MD simulations of all candidate polymers.

In (**A**), from left to right, the first 20 sequences are the globular targets, the next 20 are the swollen targets, and the remaining 20 are the rod-like targets; within each set, the sequences are ordered by ascending 〈$R_\\text{g}^2$〉, given by the white dots. The violin plots indicate the distribution of values underlying the mean, with a notch at the median value and a bar extending from the 25th to the 75th percentile values. For reference, the target value is indicated by the horizontal line, and the shaded region indicates the average spread between 25th and 75th percentiles for class I polymers of similar size. The color of each violin is based on the average composition of the total polymer sequence. In (**B**), the colors are resolved by CU and backbone/pendant group but averaged over all sequences for each specific target size. The color contributions for each bead type are shown in the boxed legend, with ∅ indicating no bead present.\n",
    "* **Figure 2: Machine learning guides design of highly stable polymer-protein hybrids.** a-c) Copolymer designs and their measured REAs for HRP, GOx, and Lip. Marginal axes at the top contain Gaussian kernel density estimate distributions of REA in the seed dataset (blue), active learning iterations 1-4 (orange), and the final exploitation round (green). Medians of distributions are indicated by vertical lines. Main axes show the experimentally measured REA for all tested PPHs; individual markers are vertically located in bins according their degree of polymerization with random fluctuations added within bins to improve visual clarity.

    "## Guidelines for Writing\n",
    "\n",
    "### The objective...\n",
    "\n",
    "Although figures are the foci of the manuscript, they cannot by themselves comprise a manuscript. Writing is still of paramount importance, addressing gaps and components of a scientific manuscript that cannot be fulfilled by figures alone. Scientific writing should be clear, understadandable, accurate, precise, and (as possible) concise. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the main text\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Abstract** - All manuscripts have abstracts. Good abstracts are essential. For some, it may be the only part that someone reads. If the abstract is compelling, then they may dive in or reserve it for another day. Less desirably, someone will disregard it as of no interest because it is unineteresting or convoluted. The abstract is essentially the whole article writ short. It should capture the essence of the paper: the motivation/rationale, the methods/approach, the new knowledge, and its effect. A good abstract will often follow the structure of\n",
    "    1. *Introduction/motivation* (1-2 sentences). This provides high-level description of the topic area to contextualize the article and identify it as relevant to the readership. This may be a brief \"X are promising materials for Y and Z\" or \"There is fundamental interest in X for Y reason\" type of thing.\n",
    "    2. *Gap statement* (1ish sentence). This needs to explain what has precluded something from happening previously, if the topic is indeed so important. What is the nature of the obstacle? Is there missing knowledge and why? This is the first chance to contextualize the importance of our work.\n",
    "    3. *Our work/approach* (1-2ish sentences). This dovetails with the gap statement. What have we done or what do we do to address the gap.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Introduction** - All manuscripts also have an introduction. The structure of the introduction is often an expansion of the abstract, except that sentences are now fleshed out into paragraphs. The *Introduction* usually has three functional purposes. It must explain and review *relevant* topics/literature so readers can both *(i)* understand the manuscript and *(ii)* appreciate its context. It must *(iii)* succinctly explain and introduce our contribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dissecting introductions is an excellent exercise in critical reading. I advocate for a structure along the following lines:\n",
    "    1. **High-level introduction** (*1 paragraph*). This paragraph needs to generally orient the reader in the field and generate immediate interest in the relevance of the current study. Note that this is an expansion of the first two points of the Abstract. References in this paragraph are usually more of a general topical nature.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. **Gap/question-oriented review of relevant literature** (*multiple paragraphs*). In subsequent paragraphs, you will unpack information that is *necessary* for the reader to understand the context and innovation of the work. Note that this information is only alluded to in the abstract, but the referenced studies likely comprise a bulk of your dedicated reading. Too often introductions become unfocused and unwieldy. Here, I like to provide paragraphs that make an important observation or point, indicate relevant literature/findings for that statement, and conclude with a remark that sets the stage for our work. For example, the paragraph could open with the statement that MD simulations are broadly useful for characterizing something pertinent to the area of our study. Subsequent sentences may delve into how MD simulations have been used to extract insights in some cases. The final sentence may pivot to note how the specific angle that is relevant to our study has not been addressed or perhaps indicating discrepancies/unresolved knowledge. \n",
    "    3. **This study...** (*~1 paragraph*). The paragraph that follows the review of relevant literature should detail how the present study (the one you are writing about) addresses gaps/questions highlighted elsewhere in the introduction. In this paragraph, we want to frame our study and define its intended scope; this can safeguard against criticisms that we didn't do $Y$ or $Z$. Often, the open may be \"In this work, XXX\" or \"Here, we YYY\" or \"To address ZZZ, we AAA\" with the variables indicating the major goal/objective/approach.  We also highlight one or two salient findings or contributions to the literature that serve as teasers and further prime readers for what's to come. We need not be too specific but also not overly vague; there should be some concreteness to the mention of methods and results so that it can be distinguished from just a generic simulation study.  From reading this paragraph, the reader should have an appreciation for what we have done and why we think it is an important/useful contribution to the literature. \n",
    "    4. **optional roadmap** (*~few sentences of last paragraph*) Occasionally, for longer papers, methods-oriented papers, or those with non-standard formats, it may be advisable to include a brief roadmap to highlight the organization of the paper. However, this is more often unnecessary.\n",

    "#### Topic and Takeaway Sentences\n",
    "Virtually every paragraph in the manuscript should start with a sentence/statement that cues the reader into what the paragraph is about or means; this is the *topic sentence*. Use them. It provides information to the reader and structure for the writer (you/us). \n",
    "\n",
    "Many (not all) paragraphs will also feature a *takeaway sentence$ that concludes the paragraph. Takeaway statements usually expand on the idea of the topic sentence, now equipped with the information that has preceded it. The function of style of topic/takeaway sentences changes depending on the section of the paper in which they appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Useful Exercise.*** Consider whether the narrative of a manuscript is logical if reduced only to topic and takeaway sentences. In so doing, it may become readily apparent that your paragraph is starting with \"the wrong\" information. This also allows one to easily and critically assess the structure and organization of the manuscript. If you have strong topic/takeaway sentences, the flow should feel very natural. A reader should understand our essential scientific narrative and argument if processing the manuscript in this manner. The balance of content is evidence in support of that narrative. Now that you know where to look/notice, examine any number of papers by Webb and members of the group for different examples of topic sentences. As you read other papers, you may see similar strategies emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Types of topic sentences.*** There are several different flavors or topic sentences that one can use. Just remember: paragraphs must have a focus and that should be clear from the outset! Below, a few types are summarized. Certainly, there are more. As appropriate, the takeaway sentence follows in parentheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "* *Factual* - these sentences usually open paragraphs that will provide information necessary to understand the narrative. These are most common in  an *Introduction* as means to motivate the present study. \n",
    "In *Methods* or *Results/Discussion*, such sentences may introduce a new concept, particularly in more of a narrative/letter format. Here are some examples:  \n",
    "    * Many condensates are believed to form spontaneously as a result of phase separation taking place close to a local thermodynamic equilibrium ($1,17$). (However, understanding the general relationship between thermodynamic stability and the internal dynamics of biomolecular condensates requires additional and systematic exploration ($23,24$).)\n",
    "    * Polymer-protein hybrids (PPHs) have emerged as attractive materials that leverage polymers to improve protein solubility and stability in often denaturing and abiological environments ($1-5$). (Thus, fit-for-purpose PPHs could facilitate myriad applications--biofuel production ($8$), plastics degradation ($9,10$), pharmaceutical synthesis ($11$)-- but a robust strategy for their design remains elusive.)\n",
    "    * Significant progress has been made in both developing facile chemical pathways for synthesis of possible precursors (i.e., the initial, unfolded polymer chains) and the characterization of resultant morphologies for SCNPs. (Knowledge relating a precursor to structure formation (and its reliability) in resulting SCNP will be crucial in achieving target functional properties of these materials.)\n",
    "    * Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide a powerful way to investigate water-surface interactions with molecular-level resolution.${}^3$ (Studies of water interactions on chemically distinct and flexible polymer surfaces appear nascent.) \n",
    "    * While the effect of modifying friction on the polymer\n",
    "relaxation times using the IFRM is roughly linear with salt\n",
    "concentration, simple and empirical descriptions for the\n",
    "viscosity of electrolyte solutions often have other functional\n",
    "dependences.${}^{32-36}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Rationale or presentation-based* - these kinds of sentences are useful for introducing an idea/mode of analysis/conceptual shift. Here are some examples: \n",
    "    * Polypeptides are chosen for characterization based on a policy of expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI), which has previously been demonstrated to converge towards a true set of Pareto-optimal sequences.\n",
    "    * To quantify changes in polymer dynamics, we compute\n",
    "Rouse-mode relaxation times for the atomistic polymers after\n",
    "mapping to discrete chains with N = 320 (SI, Section 2).\n",
    "    * Because the class II polymers do not have a fixed-length repeat\n",
    "pattern of CUs, the input featurization approach must be generalized\n",
    "to account for variable sequence lengths.\n",
    "    * We iterate with a Learn-Design-Build-Test cycle (Figure 1) to identify high-performing PPHs.\n",
    "    * To further understand the physics underlying hydrophobicity and the robustness of the nanoscale hydrophobicity metrics, we also consider structural and stereochemical variations of polymer surfaces (Figs. 1c,d). (Together, these results suggest that the simulations capture key physical interactions that dictate wettability, and these interactions are reflected by computed nanoscale hydrophobicity metrics.)\n",
    "    * We next investigate the impact of precursor patterning on the consistency of forming SCNP morphologies.\n",
    "    * We characterized 7,680 unique SCNPs across the $\\beta-f$ space by the number of free backbone beads $n_f$, the number of domains $n_d$, and the radius of gyration $R_\\text{g}$ to quantitatively examine how particular morphologies arise as a result of $\\beta$ and $f$. (Collectively, these results illustrate how sequence patterning of precursors can be manipulated to bias the morphological characteristics of SCNPs.)\n",
    "    * Given the identification of highly stable PPHs for each enzyme, we sought to understand the important chemical features of copolymers that gave rise to their performance.\n",
    "* *Point-driven* - these sentences are effectively topic/takeaway packaged together. Often if a rationale-based statement leads the paragraph, this sentence will quickly follow. In the case that the rationale is already clear, then this becomes the first sentence. Here are some examples:\n",
    "    * Both $\\beta \\Delta f_{\\sigma}$ and $\\beta \\hat{\\mu}$ quantitatively distinguish hydrophobic behavior across the amorphous polymers studied (Fig. 3).\n",
    "    * Figure 2a-c shows that the active learning paradigm facilitated identification of numerous, diverse copolymers that enhanced retained activity for each of the three enzymes. \n",
    "    * This aggregate-level analysis reveals how sequence (dis)similarity does not necessarily dictate differences in macroscopic properties in obvious ways.\n",
    "    * Outside the low-$B_2$/low-$D$ regime, differences between counterfactuals and Pareto-optimal sequences are more difficult to resolve.\n",
    "    * Figure 2A shows that fingerprints that use either size-explicit or size-implicit representations of the polymer significantly improve ML models trained to predict properties in Dataset A. \n",
    "    * Figure 4A reveals that most SFP-based strategies with size representation perform similarly, irrespective of the type of CU fingerprint and the prediction task for Dataset A.\n",
    "    * The IFRM does not reproduce MD results at finite\n",
    "salt concentrations when local increases in friction are limited\n",
    "to 3ζ0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discussing figures\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are paying attention, you might have noticed something about the way in which figures are referenced in the topic sentences. Namely, we should  generally say  what the figure or data means and ***not*** necessarily what it contains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why? It is generally unnecessary fluff to detail the type of plot. A sentence like \"The radial distribution functions of Y are shown in Figure XA\" delivers no useful content that would not be known or supplied elsewhere. We just added a sentence for no reason. Recall that we have crafted and detailed the figure sufficiently such that we need not do so again. Deliver your interpretation, \"cite\" the appropriate figure/panel as evidence, and move on. It is preferred to simply \"cut to the chase\" and indicate the major finding from our analysis. In the prior example, we are not typically interested in the specific structure of a radial distribution function but in what that function tells us about the structure of solution/assembly. So, something more along the lines of \"All systems exhibit similar aggregation irrespective of ligand chemistry (Fig. XA)\" is more informative. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples:\n",
    "    * \"Figs. 5a,b demonstrate that interfacial water dynamics indeed vary dramatically based on polymer surface chemistry.\"\n",
    "    * \"To gain further insight into hydrophobic ordering, we examine how water specifically interacts with the polymers that do not exhibit hydrogen bonding (i.e., PTFE, PE, {\\PEx}, PVC, {\\PVCx}). \n",
    "Fig. 6 shows that water orientation with respect to the polymer-water interface differs according to polymer chemistry.\n",
    "In Fig. 6a, the average orientation of water is significantly perturbed in the vicinity of PE and PVC whereas there is no orientational preference in the vicinity of PTFE.\"\n",
    "    * \"Fig. 3 demonstrates that both $\\beta \\Delta f_{\\sigma}$ and $\\hat{\\mu}_\\text{ex}$ can quantitatively distinguish hydrophobic behavior across the amorphous polymers studied.\"\n",
    "    * \"Figs. 6a,b show that sequence variability is highest for the mean value and dispersity of $P(\\langle R_\\text{g}\\rangle)$ at low $f$ and high $\\beta$ values.\"\n",
    "    * \"Fig. 4 illustrates that a single precursor sequence can give rise to a set of SCNPs with diverse morphological characteristics.\"\n",
    "    * \"Simulation durations of at least 2 microseconds are required to reach equilibrium, resulting in the formation of an interface between equilibrium condensed and dilute phases (Fig. 3a).\n",
    "As anticipated, the differences between the condensed and dilute-phase densities are anticorrelated with the second-virial coefficients, which decrease from P1 to P35 (Fig. 3b).\" \n",
    "    * *a paragraph that anticipates some primer may be needed.* \"To further explore the relationship between copolymer features and PPH activity, \n",
    "we  computed Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values [41,42]. \n",
    "to quantify how chemical features of the copolymers (fractions of incorporation and DP) contributes to REA predictions by our GPR models. \n",
    "Here, positive SHAP values indicate positive contributions REA (negative SHAP values suggest negative contributions), and we use the mean absolute SHAP value of a feature as a proxy for its overall importance to model prediction. \n",
    "Figure 3c shows that different copolymer features have distinct impact on REA predictions.\n",
    "To elucidate these differences, we compare SHAP values for the fractions of incorporation for each monomer (Figure 3d-f) and DP (Figure 3g-i) for each enzyme.\n",
    "Although we previously associated hydrophobic chemistry with high-performing PPHs for HRP (Figure 2f,i), Figure 3d reveals that the \\emph{exclusion} of BMA is favorable (higher REA), while the \\emph{inclusion} of MMA, a similar hydrophobic monomer, is associated with higher REA.\n",
    "Similar observations can be readily identified for Lip (Figure 3f), for which SPMA and TMAEMA monomers (both highly ionic) represent the most and least important features based on their mean absolute SHAP values.\n",
    "Such differences in SHAP values between monomers with the same chemical classifications underscores the intricacy of designing effective polymer-enzyme pairing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are occasional exceptions if it is deemed necessary that readers might benefit from a primer on the manner of analysis, if relevant features are uncommon, or if that presentation helps simplify the discussion. If a figure must be described, it is better to explain the essence or intent of the analysis rather than the specific manifestation. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Figure 2d-i examines both the progression of active learning and PPH performance as a function of the chemical constitution of copolymers\" rather than \"Figure 2d-i visualizes the distribution of designed copolymers produced during iterations of active learning projected onto ternary plots of copolymer composition coded by ionicity, hydrophobicity, with copolymers.\"\n",
    "* \"Fig. {\\ref{fig:6}b} also reveals subtle differences in the distribution of hydroxyl group orientations.\n",
    " For PE and \\PEx, $P(\\alpha_\\text{OH})$ for PE has a wide shoulder at around $30^\\circ$, which is commensurate with the formation of the well-known ``dangling OH bond''${}^{119,120}$ that facilitates the formation of a hydrogen-bond network; such phenomena has been noted at the water-air interface and for other water-hydrophobic surfaces.${}^{121,122}$\"\n",
